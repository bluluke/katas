# Katas
This is a repo of katas I have completed using TDD (unless stated otherwise) to keep my problem-solving skills sharp. 



## Javascript Function Descriptions:

isPangram: checks if input of string is a pangram.

scrambled: checks if all characters in the second argument are present in the first argument (not built with TDD). 

listSqaured: finds integers between 1st and 2nd argument where the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square (not built with TDD). 

sumPairs: returns first 2 integers from input array which are equal to input sum (not built with TDD). 

generateHashtag: return a hashtag from input string (not built with TDD).

permutations: return all possible permutations of characters from input string. 

calculatePossibleNumCakes: takes 2 object arguments. The first argument is a recipe with properties of ingredients and integer values representing amounts required. The second argument is an object with properties of ingredients and integer values representing amounts available. An integer is returned which is equal to the  maximum number of cakes that can be made to the recipe ingredients of the first argument from the ingredients available of the second argument.

inArray: takes two arrays as arguments. Elements of the first array which are substrings of elements in the second array are returned in lexicographical order. Uses countInstances as util function to prevent duplication of first argument elements in return values. 

convertRomanNumeral: takes a Roman numeral as an argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer.

countWhiteSpace: returns number of instances of whitespace in input 

countInNestedArrays: returns the number of instances of the second argument that are present if the first argument which is an array/nested array.
 
spaceBeforeHum:  returns an input string using camel case with a space before each hump. 

maxSequence: returns subsequence with highest sum from array of integers.

likes: returns appropriate message describng who likes something, which is dependent on input array of string names. 

categoriseMember: returns array of strings which represent categories for members: 'open' or 'senior'. as input takes array of arrays, which each contain a pair of integers: age and hanndicap. If age is over 55 and handicap greater than 7, this member is categorised as senior, and if not, the member is categorised as open. 

findOutlier: returns single odd/even integer from array of even/odd integers.

generateFibonacciSeq: returns Fibonacci sequence with the number of items determined by the input. 

isArmstrongNum returns true if input is an Armstrong number and false if it is not.

maskify: returns input with all but last 4 characters replaced with #.

sumOf2LowestPosInts: returns the sum of the two lowest positive integers from input array,



## Java Kata Descriptions:

Maps: doubles every integer in an array.

StringToNumber: converts string digit to an integer type. 
EnoughFuel: calculates if there is enough fuel when a gallon lasts 25 miles.

FakeBinary: returns string of fake binary code from input of string containing digits. An input character of 4 or below results in a 0, otherwise a 1 is produced.

SumArray: sums all integers in input array. 

ReverseString: reverses string argument. 

EndsWith: checks if first argument string ends with 2nd argument string (not built with TDD). 

SpinWords: reverses words in input string which have a length of 5 or more.
